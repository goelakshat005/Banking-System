# Banking-System
Problem Statement:
A bank system which manages usersâ€™ account information. A customer of this bank can invoke the following operations
1. Deposit (this operation increases the balance of user account by a given amt)
2. Withdraw (this operation decreases the balance of user account by given amt)
3. Enquiry ( this operation returns the balance of user account etc)
4. Customer should receive emails on transactions
5. The bank manager should be able to download excel of transaction histories for a specific time period for individual/a collection of customers 


Solution:
Run requirements.txt file using command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.

I have created two models namely 'User' and 'Transactions'. User model stores the information about the existing or a new user when created, along with balance amount in the user's account, and date of creation of amount as well.  Transactions model is for keeping a track of all the users activity including withdrawal and deposit amount along with the final amount after each transaction, and the date of transaction as well.
